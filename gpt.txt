Prompt: 
i want to clean up the contents of index.js by utilizing my config directory more. Currently, i only have paths.js, but I would love to individualize configurations for each main category of the Settings app (Samsung account, Connections, Connected devices, ..., About phone) to contain self-specific information necessary for the navigation and mapping process, such as screen_hash (for example, screen_hash for Connections would be "settings-connections", and screen_hash for Connected devices would be "settings-connected_devices"), unique UI element information and case-specific selectors, and more, such that i can implement some sort of state recognizing mechanism in processScreen, such that if mapping and iddfs is occurring inside of the category, data extraction can be dynamically adapted to meet category-specific environments and needs (from all possible elements from a given screen's XML hierarchy, which clickable elements should be initialized as buttons); naturally, this would require the implementation of a button class, which would need to allow for differentiation between buttons that lead to a new depth when clicked, buttons that represent toggles, and other buttons that represent other functionalities. How can I most efficiently and with high sense of structure, robustness, and scalability, do this? I would also want to have configuration logics that are app specific (different configurations for the Settings app, the Galaxy Notes app, etc.). I would also want to set device specific configurations perhaps. How could I best approach all of this?
